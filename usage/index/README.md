# Index

MongoDB gives the user the possibility to index desired fields of a document. ([Learn more](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/indexes/))

en2do also enables this feature, but a bit smaller than in native MongoDB.

Indexing allows faster access to entities based on the fields specified in the index.
